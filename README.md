# CompEthicsPasswordChecker

This does:
This program checks an inputted password and checks its strength. It provides some suggestions to improve weaker passwords.

To run:
To run this program an IDE to run java code would be best. However, as it takes input from System.in, could be run elsewhere as long as standard input can be provided as the program runs.

Cautions:
This tool does not perform a thorough check to make sure common words are not in the password, and can only check one password per run for now.
It also does not guarentee the security of your password, especially if the same password is used on multiple websites.

Ethical Considerations:
This tool may provide a false sense of security to people that use it, as even with a good password, data breaches can leave passwords vulnerable.
This tool could be modified to steal your password by saving the passwords you type to the computer. Don't do this.
